# Chronic kidney disease dataset

The chronic kidney disease (CKD) dataset is a processed version of the original
from <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Chronic_Kidney_Disease>.

See [the processed CKD dataset
page](https://github.com/matthew-brett/datasets/tree/1ac6d8c/ckd) for more
detail.

The data are blood tests and other measures from patients with and without CKD.
There are 400 rows, one per patient; these are patients seen over a period of
about two months at some point before July 2015, in a hospital in Tamil Nadu,
India; maybe [Apollo Reach
Karaikudi](https://www.purplehealth.com/10765-DrSoundarapandianPS).

Of the 400 rows, 250 correspond to patients *with* CKD and the remaining 150
rows correspond to patients *without* CKD.  This information is in the "Class"
column of the dataset.

Here is a description of each column, from the header of the [original data
file](https://github.com/matthew-brett/datasets/blob/1ac6d8c/ckd/chronic_kidney_disease_full.arff)
with some annotations by me (Matthew Brett), each preceded by "MB: ":

*   Age: age in years
*   Blood Pressure: : BP in mm/Hg (MB: presumably diastolic blood pressure)
*   Specific Gravity: one of (1.005,1.010,1.015,1.020,1.025); (MB: see
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine_specific_gravity>)
*   Albumin: one of (0,1,2,3,4,5) (MB: in urine)
*   Sugar: one of (0,1,2,3,4,5) (MB: in urine)
*   Red Blood Cells: one of ("normal", "abnormal") (MB: in urine)
*   Pus Cell: one of ("normal", "abnormal") (MB: in urine)
*   Pus Cell clumps: one of ("present", "notpresent") (MB: in urine)
*   Bacteria: one of ("present", "notpresent") (MB: in urine)
*   Blood Glucose Random: in mgs/dl
*   Blood Urea: in mgs/dl
*   Serum Creatinine: in mgs/dl
*   Sodium: in mEq/L
*   Potassium: in mEq/L
*   Hemoglobin: in gms
*   Packed Cell Volume: (MB: volume percentage; see
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematocrit>)
*   White Blood Cell Count: in cells/cumm
*   Red Blood Cell Count: in millions/cmm
*   Hypertension: one of ("yes", "no")
*   Diabetes Mellitus: one of ("yes", "no")
*   Coronary Artery Disease: one of ("yes", "no")
*   Appetite: one of ("good", "poor")
*   Pedal Edema: one of ("yes", "no")
*   Anemia: one of ("yes", "no")
*   Class : one of ("ckd", "notckd") in `ckd_full.csv`) or (1,0) in
    `ckd_clean.csv`, where 1 corresponds to "ckd").

`ckd_clean.csv` has the same data as `ckd_full.csv`, but with all rows
containing missing values dropped.  Also, the last column `Class` has a different coding, as above.

L. Jerlin Rubini created the data, with the collaboration of Doctors P.
Soundarapandian and P. Eswaran. See the original file or the link above for
details.
