# Statistical Techniques

Modern data analysis involves techniques from several fields, including
statistics and machine learning.

Statistics is the body of knowledge about drawing conclusions from incomplete
information.  Put another way, statistics allows us to reason about data in
the presence of uncertainty.

Among the statistical tools that we will use are hypothesis testing and tools for prediction of new data.

Because we are doing data science, we will take a rather different approach
from standard statistical teaching.  Data science puts coding at the heart of
data analysis. Coding gives us a much more powerful set of tools than have
been available in the past.  This has great benefits for analysis, but also
for teaching.

The benefits for analysis are that we can get, clean, and analyze a much wider
range of data.  It becomes natural to extend our methods of analysis to
techniques based in computation, like machine learning.

The benefits for teaching are two-fold.  The first benefit is our ability to
analyze real data.  The greater power and range of our tools allow us to
analyze real-world, messy data instead of cleaned-up toy datasets, so you are
better prepared to analyze the real data you will soon have to deal with in
your education and work.  The second benefit is that an emphasis on
computation allows us to use richer, simpler and more powerful techniques,
based in resampling, that are easier to explain, and have a deeper
relationship to the models that we are using.  We will rely much less on
mathematics, and that gives us time to explain the ideas in another way, and
in more depth.
