# On confidence

Thus far we have worried about two fundamental questions.  In each case we have a *sample* of data from some *universe* or *population*, and we want to draw conclusions about the universe (population) from the sample.

Our questions are:

*   Is our observed sample likely to be compatible with a null universe?  This
    is *statistical inference*.
*   Can we classify new data from the same universe using information from the
    sample --- *classification*.

In this section we think about another common question that we ask about a sample --- how close are measures from our sample likely to be the same measures from the universe or population?

We now enter the world of *confidence intervals*.  We soon discover a tool
called the *bootstrap*.
