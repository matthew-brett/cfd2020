## Berkeley Foundations of Data Science license

Various elements of this course are derived from the [excellent
textbook](https://www.inferentialthinking.com) for UC Berkeley's
course [Foundations of Data Science](http://data8.org).

Specifically, the versions of the Berkeley pages that I am using here
come from last commit in that repository that is licensed with
a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC license \-
[64b20f0](https://github.com/data-8/textbook/commit/64b20f0).  The
subsequent commit \-
[710ed4e](https://github.com/data-8/textbook/commit/710ed4e) \-
relicensed the work with a CC-BY-NC-ND license, forbidding derivative
works.

I've indicated every page derived from the Berkeley course, at the
bottom of the page.  These pages follow the same CC-BY-NC license as
the original - see [the README for commit
64b20f0](https://github.com/data-8/textbook/blob/64b20f0452a31545d9fbc8f34a9e86035cd56e45/README.md).
