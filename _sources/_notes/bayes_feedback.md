"Do not worry about the details of the text below for now, this page
explains what the rules mean." â€” the student wouldn't yet know what to
not worry about!

Variable naming: box4_1, box2_3 ?

I'd write p_red_for_box_4 = 4/5, ... = 2/5

In code `green` -> `color?`

"Remember our two boxes" that points to two probabilities is
confusing.  I'd remind them of the problem and the contents of the
boxes, and THEN remind them that they'd get each with the following
probabilities.

I find the flow somewhat counter intuitive.  We do an experiment, then
we note that this outcome is *magical relationship (x times y)*.  The
student has no way to uncover such a magical relationship!

Rather, I would say: we're going to do this experiment.  Now, what
would we expect to find?  Then, use the sankey diagram to explore.
Then, run the code to confirm that reasoning was correct.

Whenever possible, I try to help the students to uncover what they need to learn themselves.  I.e., I try not to present the result and then retrospectively go and explain it.

This was a very hard thing for me in my engineering course.  They often showed you that something was true, instead of showing you how to derive it.
