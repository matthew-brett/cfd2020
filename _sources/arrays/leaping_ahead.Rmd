# Leaping ahead

We are still building up to a solution for the [three girls
problem](../code-basics/three_girls).

We have more of the building blocks we need.

```{python}
# Load the Numpy package, and rename to "np"
import numpy as np
```

We are going to simulate 10000 families, each with four children.

Call one family *one trial*.  Each *trial* involves the simulation of four children.

Here we put together what we have up until now.  We are creating a Numpy array that has 10000 values, each of which is 0

```{python}
# Make an array of zeros to store the counts for each of the 10000 families.
counts = np.zeros(10000)
counts
```

`counts` has 10000 elements. When we have finished, each of these 10000 values
will be the number of girls in one simulated family.

From [boolean arrays](boolean_arrays), here is how we make an array that
simulates a family of four children, and count the number of girls.

```{python}
# Make an array of four random integers that are either 0 or 1.
# 1 means a girl.
family = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=4)
# Add up the integers to count the number of girls.
count = np.sum(family)
count
```

We can store this count at the beginning of our 10000 counts:

```{python}
# Store the count as the first value in the counts array.
counts[0] = count
# Show the first 10 values
counts[:10]
```

Here that is again, in a single cell:

```{python}
# Our first simulated family
family = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=4)
counts[0] = np.sum(family)
counts[:10]
```

To add another family, we just repeat the same, but storing the result as the
*second* value in the `counts` array:

```{python}
# Our second simulated family
family = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=4)
counts[1] = np.sum(family)
counts[:10]
```

Notice that the only thing that changed is that we stored the value at position (offset) 1 instead of position (offset) 0.

Obviously this is getting a bit boring and repetitive. Surely we can do
better.

Yes indeed, we can use a *for loop*.  We will see much more of for loops [very
soon](../iteration/iteration).  You will recognize nearly all the code below, from the single trials we did above.  The new thing is the *for* loop, that tells Python to repeat the indented steps 10000 times.

```{python}
# Reset the counts array to 10000 zeros.
counts = np.zeros(10000)

# Repeat the indented stuff 10000 times.
for i in np.arange(10000):
    # The procedure for one family.
    family = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=4)
    count = np.sum(family)
    # Store the count at position i in the counts array.
    counts[i] = count
# Show the first 10 counts
counts[:10]
```

Now we have a count of the number of girls, from 10000 simulated families:

```{python}
len(counts)
```

We use [Boolean arrays](boolean_arrays) to make an array of 10000 elements, where each element is True if the corresponding element in `counts` was equal to 3, and False otherwise.

```{python}
# The Boolean array
has_3_girls = counts == 3
```

`np.count_nonzero` counts the number of True values (and therefore, the number of `counts` equal to 3).

```{python}
# Number of counts values equal to 3.
n_3_girls = np.count_nonzero(has_3_girls)
n_3_girls
```

Finally we estimate the probability by dividing the number of times we saw 3 by
the number of trials:

```{python}
# Estimate probability of 3 girls.
n_3_girls / 10000
```

## The whole thing

Here then is the whole solution to three girl problem.

It is made from the combination of the code in the cells above.

```{python}
# Reset the counts array to 10000 zeros.
counts = np.zeros(10000)

# Repeat the indented stuff 10000 times.
for i in np.arange(10000):
    # The procedure for one family.
    family = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=4)
    count = np.sum(family)
    # Store the count at position i in the counts array.
    counts[i] = count

# True where counts has the value 3, False otherwise.
has_3_girls = counts == 3

# Number of counts values equal to 3.
n_3_girls = np.count_nonzero(has_3_girls)

# Estimate and show probability of 3 girls.
n_3_girls / 10000
```

## For loops.

The new part of this story is the *for loop*.  On to [iteration with for
loops](../iteration/iteration).
