{ucb-page}`Joining_Tables_by_Columns`

Often, data about the same individuals is maintained in more than one table.
For example, one university office might have data about each student's time
to completion of degree, while another has data about the student's tuition
and financial aid.

To understand the students' experience, it may be helpful to put the two
datasets together. If the data are in two tables, each with one row per
student, then we would want to put the columns together, making sure to match
the rows so that each student's information remains on a single row.

Let us do this in the context of a simple example, and then use the method
with a larger dataset.


Suppose we have a data frame for different flavors of ice cream.  Each flavor
of ice cream comes with a rating that is in a separate table.

```{python}
cones = pd.DataFrame()
cones['Flavor'] = ['strawberry', 'vanilla', 'chocolate', 'strawberry',
                   'chocolate']
cones['Price'] = [3.55, 4.75, 6.55, 5.25, 5.75]
cones
```

```{python}
ratings = pd.DataFrame()
ratings['Flavor'] = ['strawberry', 'chocolate', 'vanilla']
ratings['Stars'] = [2.5, 3.5, 4]
ratings
```

Each of the tables has a column that contains ice cream flavors. In both
cases, the column has the name `Flavor`. The entries in these columns can be
used to link the two tables.

The method `merge` creates a new table in which each cone in the `cones` table
is augmented with the Stars information in the `ratings` table.  For each cone
in `cones`, `merge` finds a row in `ratings` whose `Flavor` matches the cone's
`Flavor`. We have to tell `merge` to use the `Flavor` column for matching,
using the `on` keyword argument.

```{python}
rated = cones.merge(ratings, on='Flavor')
rated
```

Each cone now has not only its price but also the rating of its flavor.

In general, a call to `merge` that augments a table (say `table1`) with information from another table (say `table2`) looks like this:

    table1.merge(table2, on=column_for_merging)


In the case above, the matching columns have the name column name: `Flavor`.

This need not be so.   For example, let us rename the `Flavor` column in `ratings` to `Kind`:

```{python}
# Rename the 'Flavor' column to 'Kind'
ratings_renamed = ratings.copy()
ratings_renamed.columns = ['Kind', 'Stars']
ratings_renamed
```

Now we have to tell `merge` the name of the column to merge on, for each data frame.  The first data frame (`cones` in our case) is called the *left* data frame.  The second (`ratings` in our case) is called the *right* data frame.  Now the columns have different names in the left and right data frame, we have to use the `left_on` and `right_on` keywords.

```{python}
rated_again = cones.merge(ratings_renamed, left_on='Flavor', right_on='Kind')
rated_again
```

Here is a more general skeleton of a `merge` between `table1` and `table2`, where the corresponding columns may have different names:

    table1.merge(table2, left_on=table1_column, right_on=table2_column)


Now that we have done the merge, the new table `rated` (or `rated_again`)
allows us to work out the price per star, which you can think of as an
informal measure of value. Low values are good – they mean that you are paying
less for each rating star.

```{python}
rated['$/Star'] = rated['Price'] / rated['Stars']
rated.sort_values('$/Star').head(3)
```

Though strawberry has the lowest rating among the three flavors, the less
expensive strawberry cone does well on this measure because it doesn't cost a
lot per star.


**Caution.** Order matters. Since we use the second table in a `merge` to
augment the first table, it is important that each row in the first table has
exactly one matching row in the second. If a row in the first table is missing
a match in the second table, information can be lost. If a row in the first
table has more than one match in the second table, `merge` will pick just one,
which is also a kind of information loss.

We can see this in the following example, which tries to merge the same two
tables by the same two columns, but in the other order. This merge does not
make sense: it is attempting to augment the rating of each flavor with its
price, but according to the `cones` table, there is more than one cone (and
price) for each flavor. The result is that two of the cones end up vanishing.
The `merge` method just finds the first row corresponding to `chocolate` in
`cones` and ignores the other one.

```{python}
ratings_renamed.merge(cones, left_on='Kind', right_on='Flavor')
```

Suppose there is a table of professional reviews of some ice cream cones, and
we have found the average review for each flavor.

```{python}
reviews = pd.DataFrame()
reviews['Flavor'] = ['vanilla', 'chocolate', 'vanilla', 'chocolate']
reviews['ProfStars'] = [5, 3, 5, 4]
reviews
```

Remember [group by](groupby):

```{python}
average_review = reviews.groupby('Flavor').mean()
average_review
```

Notice that the column that we grouped by — `Flavor` — has become the Index (row labels).

We can merge `cones` and `average_review` by providing the labels of the
columns by which to merge.  As you will see, Pandas treats the data frame Index
as being a column, for this purpose.

First we remind ourselves of the contents of `cones`:

```{python}
cones
```

Here is the result of the merge:

```{python}
cones.merge(average_review, left_on='Flavor', right_on='Flavor')
```

Of course in this case the "columns" have the same name, and we can do the same
thing with:

```{python}
cones.merge(average_review, on='Flavor')
```

Notice that `Flavor` is the Index (row labels) for `average_review`, but Pandas
allows this, because it sees the Index name is `Flavor`, and treats it as a
column.

For this reason, merge can also merge with a Series, because the Series can
have a name.  At the moment `average_review` is a Dataframe with one column:
`ProfStars`.  We can pull out this column as a Series.  You may remember that
the Series also gets the Index, and a name, from the column name:

```{python}
avg_rev_as_series = average_review['ProfStars']
avg_rev_as_series
```

Because this Series has a name: `Flavor`, and that is the name of its Index, we can do the same merge with this Series as we did with the Dataframe above:

```{python}
cones.merge(avg_rev_as_series, on='Flavor')
```


## What remains?

Notice that, after our merge, the strawberry cones have disappeared. Merge is
pursuing a particular strategy here, and that is to look for labels that match
in the matching columns. None of the reviews are for strawberry cones, so there
is nothing to which the `strawberry` rows can be merged. This might be what you
want, or it might not be — that depends on the analysis we are trying to
perform with the merged table.  If it is not what you want, you may want to ask
merge to use a different strategy.


## Merge strategies

Let us reflect further on the choice that merge made above, when it dropped the
row for strawberry cones.  As you saw above, by default, `merge` looks for
labels that are present in *both* of the matching columns.  This is the default
merge strategy, called an *inner* merge.  We could also call this an
*intersection* merge strategy.

For this default *inner* merge strategy, `merge` first found all the flavor
labels in `cones['Flavor']`:

```{python}
# Different values in cones['Flavor']
cone_flavors = cones['Flavor'].unique()
cone_flavors
```

Then it found all the flavors in `average_review` `'Flavor'` "column" (in this case it found the index):

```{python}
# Different values in average_reviews['Flavor']
review_flavors = average_review.index.unique()
review_flavors
```

Next `merge` found all the `Flavor` values that are present in *both* data frames.  We can call this the *intersection* of the two sets of values.  Python has a `set` type to work out intersections and other set operations.

```{python}
flavors_in_both = set(cone_flavors).intersection(review_flavors)
flavors_in_both
```

Merge then throws away any rows in either table that don't have one of these
intersection values in the matching columns.  This is how we lost the `strawberry` row from the `cones` table.

This *inner* or *intersection* strategy is often useful — that is why it is the
default.  But we may want to do something different.  For example, we may want to keep flavors that don't have reviews in our merge result, but get a missing value for the review score.  One way of doing that is the *left* merge strategy.  Here merge keeps all rows from from the left data frame, but, for each row where there is no corresponding label in the right data frame, it fills the row values from the right data frame with missing values.

```{python}
# A merge using the "left" strategy
cones.merge(average_review, on='Flavor', how='left')
```
