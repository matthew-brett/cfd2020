# Coding for data courses

Course materials and notes for data science courses at the University of
Birmingham.

This textbook is based on the Berkeley Foundations of Data Science
course. The most recent version of the course is at [Computational and
Inferential Thinking](https://www.inferentialthinking.com).  The
repository for the textbook is [on
Github](https://github.com/data8/textbook).

Versions of the Berkeley course come from the last commit in that
repository that is licensed with a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC license
- `64b20f0`.  The following commit (`710ed4e`) relicensed the work
with a CC-BY-NC-ND license, forbidding derivative works.

## Machinery

The template for this website comes from <https://jupyterbook.org> - many
thanks to the authors.

## Getting started for working on the repository

Say your Github username is `my-gh-user`.

Go to the repository page that houses this README - for example <https://github.co/matthew-brett/cfd2020>.

Click on "Fork" button near top right, to make your own fork of the
repository, that will now be at `https://github.com/my-gh-user/<repo-name>` where `<repo-name>` is the name of the repository housing this README.

The following assumes that the README is in
<https://github.com/matthew-brett/cfd2020>.  The name of the repository is
therefore `cfd2020`.  Substitute URL and repository name throughout.

Clone the main repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/matthew-brett/cfd2020
```

Add a remote for your fork:

```
cd cfd2020
git remote add my-gh-user https://github.com/my-gh-user/cfd2020.git
git fetch my-gh-user
```

Get any submodules for the repository (you may need these for the
build):

```
git submodule update --init
```

Install the code modules and build dependencies for this book:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Start by making some branch to work on, linked to your fork.  Use
a name to match the kind of changes you are about to make, like
`rewrite-intro-pages`:

```
git branch rewrite-intro-pages
git checkout rewrite-intro-pages
```

Associate this branch with your fork:

```
git push my-gh-user rewrite-intro-pages -u
```

The `-u` flag above stores the association of this branch with your
fork, referenced by `my-gh-user`.

## Installing stuff for building / serving the repository files

If you use [Conda](https://conda.io/docs) then you might make a Conda
environment for working on the repo.  I don't, I use pip, and I make
a virtual environment.  You can do that like this:

```
python3 -m venv my-venv
source my-virtualenv/bin/activate
```

Or, if you have
[virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
(I do) then, you might prefer:

```
python3 -m venv $WORKON_HOME/my-venv
workon my-venv
```

Install the Python packages you need for building the site:

```
pip install -r build_requirements.txt
```

Finally, check that you can build the pages locally with:

```
make html
```

## Configuring Jupyter to save / load in R Markdown

I'm using the excellent [Jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext)
to make it easier to edit Jupyter Notebooks.  Jupytext automates
saving Notebook files as Markdown (and other formats), and loading
them from edited Markdown (and other formats).

You need to configure Jupyter to use it.  If you don't have a Jupyter
configuration, do:

```
jupyter notebook --generate-config
```

You should now have a file `~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py`.
Append these lines:

```
c.NotebookApp.contents_manager_class = "jupytext.TextFileContentsManager"
c.ContentsManager.default_jupytext_formats = "ipynb,Rmd"
```

I also turned off autosave globally, by following the instructions [in
this stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45980165).
This stops autosave saving over any edits that I am making in the
Markdown source.

**Be careful** - if you are used to autosave in Jupyter, you can
easily lose work when you disable autosave.

```
mkdir -p ~/.jupyter/custom
```

Add the following line to `~/.jupyter/custom/custom.js`:

```
Jupyter.notebook.set_autosave_interval(0); // disable autosave
```

Finally, you may want to clone the original Berkeley textbook:

```
# Get out of cfd2020 tree
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/data-8/textbook
```

**Make sure you are using the last commit we can legally use, from the
Berkeley repository**:

```
cd textbook
# Checkout the last CC-BY-NC commit
git checkout 64b20f0
```

## Extra stuff

Consider installing [hub](https://github.com/github/hub) to make
interactions with Github easier, from the command line.

## Configuring build etc

You might want to check the instructions for configuring the build at
<https://jupyterbook.org>.

## Workflow

### Developing

* Edit `.Rmd` and / or `.ipynb` files
* `make html` to rebuild `.ipynb` from more recent `.Rmd`
  files, and rebuild `.md` files from more recent `.ipynb` files.
* Review in browser

### Shipping

* Final check
* Ship with `make github`
