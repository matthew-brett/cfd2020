# The mean

The mean is an important value to summarize and predict a distribution.

It has two interesting properties:

* The sum of all deviations around the mean is zero;
* It is the value that gives the smallest sum of squared deviations.

These properties are useful to think about when we are looking for a line to
describe the relationship of one value to another.
