# Arrays

There are several kinds of sequences in Python.  A [list](lists) is one.  However, the sequence type that we will use most in the class, is the array.

The `numpy` package, abbreviated `np` in programs, provides Python programmers
with convenient and powerful functions for creating and manipulating arrays.

```{python}
# Load the numpy package, and call it "np".
import numpy as np
```

## Creating arrays


The `array` function from the Numpy package creates an array from single values, or sequences of values.

For example, remember `my_list`?

```{python}
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
```

This is a `list`:

```{python}
type(my_list)
```

The `array` function from Numpy can make an array from this list:

```{python}
my_array = np.array(my_list)
my_array
```

As you can see from the display above, this is an array.  We confirm it with `type`:

```{python}
type(my_array)
```

We can also create the list and then the array in one call, like this:

```{python}
my_array = np.array([1, 2, 3])
my_array
```

Here `[1, 2, 3]` is an *expression* that returns a list. `np.array` then operates on the returned list, to create an array.

Arrays often contain numbers, but, like lists, they can also contain strings
or other types of values.  However, a single array can only contain a single
kind of data. (It usually doesn't make sense to group together unlike data
anyway.)

For example,

```{python}
english_parts_of_speech = np.array(["noun", "pronoun", "verb", "adverb", "adjective", "conjunction", "preposition", "interjection"])
english_parts_of_speech
```

We have not seen this yet, but Python allows us to spread expressions between
round and square brackets across many lines.  It knows that the expression has
not finished yet because it is waiting for the closing bracket.  For example, this cell works in the exactly the same way as the cell above, and may be easier to read:

```{python}
# An expression between brackets spread across many lines.
english_parts_of_speech = np.array(
    ["noun",
    "pronoun",
    "verb",
    "adverb",
    "adjective",
    "conjunction",
    "preposition",
    "interjection"]
    )
english_parts_of_speech
```

Below, we collect four different temperatures into a list called `temps`.
These are the [estimated average daily high
temperatures](http://berkeleyearth.lbl.gov/regions/global-land) over all land
on Earth (in degrees Celsius) for the decades surrounding 1850, 1900, 1950,
and 2000, respectively, expressed as deviations from the average absolute high
temperature between 1951 and 1980, which was 14.48 degrees.

If you are interested, you can get more data from [this file of daily high
temperatures](http://berkeleyearth.lbl.gov/auto/Regional/TMAX/Text/global-land-TMAX-Trend.txt).

```{python}
baseline_high = 14.48
highs = np.array([baseline_high - 0.880,
                  baseline_high - 0.093,
                  baseline_high + 0.105,
                  baseline_high + 0.684])
highs
```

## Calculations with arrays


Arrays can be used in arithmetic expressions to compute over their contents.
When an array is combined with a single number, that number is combined with
each element of the array. Therefore, we can convert all of these temperatures
to Fahrenheit by writing the familiar conversion formula.

```{python}
(9/5) * highs + 32
```

As we saw for strings, arrays have *methods*, which are functions that
operate on the array values. The `mean` of a collection of numbers is its
average value: the sum divided by the length. Each pair of parentheses in the
examples below is part of a call expression; it's calling a function with no
arguments to perform a computation on the array called `highs`.

```{python}
# The number of elements in the array
highs.size
```

```{python}
highs.sum()
```

```{python}
highs.mean()
```

## Functions on Arrays


Numpy provides various useful functions for operating on arrays.

For example, the `diff` function computes the difference between each adjacent
pair of elements in an array. The first element of the `diff` is the second
element minus the first.

```{python}
np.diff(highs)
```

The [full Numpy reference](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/) lists
these functions exhaustively, but only a small subset are used commonly for
data processing applications. These are grouped into different packages within
`np`. Learning this vocabulary is an important part of learning the Python
language, so refer back to this list often as you work through examples and
problems.

However, you **don't need to memorize these**.  Use this as a reference.

Each of these functions takes an array as an argument and returns a single
value.
