# Leaping ahead

We are still building up to a solution for the [three girls
problem](../code-basics/three_girls).

We have more of the building blocks we need.

First we load the Numpy library.

```{python}
# Load the Numpy package, and rename to "np"
import numpy as np
```

We are going to simulate 10000 families, each with four children.

Here we put together some things you've seen before.  We are creating a Numpy array from an empty list.  We get an empty array.

```{python}
# Make an empty array to store counts of girls in each family
counts = np.array([])
counts
```

`counts` will eventually have 10000 elements where each will be the number of girls in one simulated family.

Remembering [function arguments](function_arguments), here is how we make
an array that simulates a family of four children:

```{python}
# Get an array of 4 integers from 0 up to, but not including 2.
# (Therefore, 4 integers that can be either 0 or 1).
family = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=4)
family
```

We represented girls with a value of one. We can count the number of girls by using the `np.sum` function on the `family` array:

```{python}
count = np.sum(family)
count
```

We want to build up a lot of counts, in the `counts` array, so we start by appending the `count` value:

```{python}
# Store the count in the counts array.
counts = np.append(counts, count)
counts
```

We can do this again in a single cell, like this:

```{python}
# A second family
family = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=4)
count = np.sum(family)

# Store the count in the counts array.
counts = np.append(counts, count)
counts
```

To add another family, we just repeat the same:

```{python}
# A third family
family = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=4)
count = np.sum(family)

# Store the count in the counts array.
counts = np.append(counts, count)
counts
```

Obviously this is getting a bit boring and repetitive. Surely we can do better.

Yes indeed, we can use a *for loop*.  We will see much more of for loops [very
soon](../arrays-iteration/iteration).  Here's a preview:

```{python}
# Reset the counts array to empty.
counts = np.array([])

# Repeat the indented stuff 10000 times.
for i in np.arange(10000):
    # The procedure for one family.
    family = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=4)
    count = np.sum(family)
    # Store the count in the counts array.
    counts = np.append(counts, count)
counts
```

Now we have a count of the number of girls, from 10000 simulated families:

```{python}
len(counts)
```

Our next problem is to find how many of these `counts` are equal to 3.

Remember [comparison](Comparison)?

Imagine I have some value `count`, like this:

```{python}
count = 3
count
```

I can use the `==` comparison to test if `count` is equal to 3:

```{python}
# A comparison expression, asking whether "count" is equal to 3.
count == 3
```

What do you think we will get if do the same test on all 10000 values in `counts`?

```{python}
counts == 3
```

This is a new 10000 element array of True and False values.  It is called a *Boolean array*.  We will see many more of these.

Next we will use a Numpy function called `count_nonzero`.   It counts the number of values in an array that are not equivalent to 0.   It turns out that `False` is equivalent to 0, but `True` is not:

```{python}
np.count_nonzero(False)
```

```{python}
np.count_nonzero(True)
```

```{python}
my_booleans = np.array([True, False, True])
np.count_nonzero(my_booleans)
```

This means that `count_nonzero` returns the number of True values in a Boolean array.  Now we can count how many of the `counts` array were equal to 3.

```{python}
# The Boolean array, with True where counts equal to 3, False otherwise.
has_3_girls = counts == 3

# Number of counts values equal to 3.
n_3_girls = np.count_nonzero(has_3_girls)
n_3_girls
```

Finally we estimate the probability by dividing the number of times we saw 3 by the number of trials:

```{python}
# Estimate probability of 3 girls.
n_3_girls / 10000
```

## The whole thing

Here then is the whole solution to three girl problem.

It is make from the combination of the code in the cells above.

```{python}
# Reset the counts array to empty.
counts = np.array([])

# Repeat the indented stuff 10000 times.
for i in np.arange(10000):
    # The procedure for one family.
    family = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=4)
    count = np.sum(family)
    # Store the count in the counts array.
    counts = np.append(counts, count)

# True where counts has the value 3, False otherwise.
has_3_girls = counts == 3

# Number of counts values equal to 3.
n_3_girls = np.count_nonzero(has_3_girls)

# Estimate and show probability of 3 girls.
n_3_girls / 10000
```

## For loops.

The new part of this story is the *for loop*.  On to [iteration with for
loops](../arrays-iteration/iteration).
