# Numpy append

We have already seen how to build a Numpy array from a sequence of values.


```{python}
# Load the Numpy package, and rename to "np"
import numpy as np
```

One way to create an array is to make a sequence of values, such as a list, and pass these to the `np.array` function, like this:

```{python}
my_list = [1.1, 2.2, 3.2, 2.1]
my_array = np.array(my_list)
my_array
```

Here we create the full 4 value array in one call to `np.array`.

Another way make an array is to build it up one value at a time.

To do this, I can start with an empty array, like this:

```{python}
an_empty_list = []
a = np.array(an_empty_list)
a
```

Now imagine I want to build up the same array as I did above.  I can *append* each value to the array, using the `np.append` function.

As usual, you can check what the `np.append` function does by making a new cell in the notebook, and typing `np.append?` followed by Enter.  This will show you the help for `np.append`.

You will find that `np.append` needs (at least) two *arguments*, which are:

1. The array to append to, called `arr` in the documentation and
2. The stuff to append, called `values` in the documentation.

Here we append a single number:

```{python}
a = np.append(a, 1.1)
a
```

```{python}
a = np.append(a, 2.2)
a
```

```{python}
a = np.append(a, 3.2)
a
```

```{python}
a = np.append(a, 2.1)
a
```

This seems slow and laborious, but we will soon see this can be useful when we want to calculate and store a sequence of values.
